# 🔒 SecureChat - Fort Knox Level Security

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING
**CHANGE THE KILL SWITCH PASSCODE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEPLOYMENT!**

Default passcode: `SECURE_CHAT_KILL_SWITCH_2024`

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **PGP Encryption**: All messages encrypted with Curve25519 ECC PGP keys
- **Base64 Encoding**: All code and sensitive data base64 encoded
- **Kill Switch**: Instant site termination with passcode protection
- **No Logging**: Zero persistent logs or traces
- **Memory Only**: All data stored in RAM, cleared on restart
- **404 Response**: Site appears to never exist when kill switch activated
- **Static HTML Interface**: Clean, maintainable HTML files with orange/black theme
- **24/7 Uptime**: Deployed on Railway cloud platform

## 🚀 Quick Deployment to Railway

### Option 1: Railway CLI (Recommended)
1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

### Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial SecureChat deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Railway**
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will auto-deploy

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:

```
KILL_SWITCH_PASSCODE=YOUR_SECURE_PASSCODE_HERE
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 🔐 How It Works

### Encryption Process
1. Server generates PGP key pair on startup
2. Client generates PGP key pair on connection
3. All messages encrypted with recipient's public key
4. Server never sees unencrypted messages
5. Only recipient can decrypt with their private key

### Kill Switch
1. Click "🚨 KILL SWITCH" button
2. Enter correct passcode
3. Server immediately:
   - Clears all memory
   - Deletes all keys
   - Returns 404 for all requests
   - No trace left behind

### Security Measures
- **No Database**: Everything in memory only
- **No Logs**: Zero persistent logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse (50 requests/15min)
- **Helmet Security**: Security headers
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-origin security
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Passcode**: Immediately change kill switch passcode
2. **Use HTTPS**: Railway provides SSL automatically
3. **Monitor Connections**: Watch Railway logs for suspicious activity
4. **Regular Restarts**: Railway handles this automatically
5. **Environment Variables**: Keep passcode in Railway secrets
