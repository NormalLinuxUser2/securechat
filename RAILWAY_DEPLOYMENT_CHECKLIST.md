# 🚀 Railway Deployment Checklist for End-to-End Encryption

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Dependencies

- [x] `express@^4.18.2` - Web server
- [x] `socket.io@^4.7.2` - Real-time communication
- [x] `helmet@^7.0.0` - Security headers
- [x] `express-rate-limit@^6.8.1` - Rate limiting
- [x] `cors@^2.8.5` - CORS handling

### ✅ Files Ready
- [x] `server.js` - Updated with PGP encryption
- [x] `public/app.js` - Client-side encryption
- [x] `public/index.html` - OpenPGP.js integration
- [x] `PGP/0x16BA41A8-pub.asc` - Server public key
- [x] `PGP/0x16BA41A8-sec.asc` - Server private key
- [x] `package.json` - Updated with test scripts

## 🚀 Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. **Push to Git Repository**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement end-to-end PGP encryption"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Railway Auto-Deploy**
- Railway will automatically detect changes
- Build process will install dependencies
- Server will start with encryption enabled

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
After deployment, check these endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Server public key
curl https://your-app.railway.app/publickey

# Connected clients (for debugging)
curl https://your-app.railway.app/clients
```

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. **Open Multiple Browser Tabs**
- Navigate to your Railway app URL
- Open 2-3 tabs to simulate multiple users
- Enter the site password: `MoneyMakingMen16$`

### 2. **Check Encryption Status**
In browser console, you should see:
```
🔐 Initializing PGP encryption...
✅ Client PGP keys generated successfully
🔑 Server public key received
🔐 End-to-end encryption established
```

### 3. **Test Message Encryption**
- Send messages between tabs
- Check server logs in Railway dashboard
- Messages should appear as encrypted data

### 4. **Verify Security Features**
- [x] Messages are encrypted in transit
- [x] Server cannot read message content
- [x] Each client has unique encryption keys
- [x] Kill switch functionality works
- [x] Rate limiting is active

## 🛡️ Security Verification

### Server Logs Should Show:
```
🔑 Client public key received for [socket-id]
🔐 Encrypted message received from [username]
📤 Encrypted message forwarded to [recipient]
```

### Client Console Should Show:
```
🔐 Encrypting message for end-to-end transmission...
🔐 Encrypted message sent to server
🔐 Received encrypted message from server
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)

If you need to customize settings:

```bash
# In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

# Custom kill switch passcode
KILL_SWITCH_PASSCODE=your_secure_passcode_here

# Allowed origins for CORS (if needed)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://anotherdomain.com
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Encryption Fails:
1. **Check Railway logs** for PGP initialization errors
2. **Verify OpenPGP.js loads** in browser console
3. **Test with multiple browsers** to isolate issues
4. **Check HTTPS** - encryption requires secure connection

### Common Issues:
- **"PGP not initialized"** → Check if OpenPGP.js library loaded
- **"Encryption failed"** → Verify client key generation
- **"Decryption failed"** → Check key exchange between clients

## 📊 Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard:
- Monitor server logs for encryption events
- Check memory usage (encryption uses more RAM)
- Monitor connection count and message throughput

### Browser DevTools:
- Check Network tab for encrypted message payloads
- Monitor Console for encryption/decryption logs
- Verify WebSocket connections are secure (wss://)

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Multiple users can connect simultaneously
- ✅ Messages are encrypted in server logs
- ✅ Messages are readable in client interface
- ✅ Kill switch functionality works
- ✅ No encryption errors in logs

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **HTTPS Required**: Railway provides HTTPS automatically
- **No Key Storage**: Client keys are generated per session
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each session has unique keys
- **Zero-Knowledge Server**: Server never sees plaintext messages
